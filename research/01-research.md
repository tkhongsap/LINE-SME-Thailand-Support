## Product Requirements Document (PRD)

### \*“Thai SME Support” LINE Official Account (OA)

---

### 1. Purpose & Vision

Create a **centralized LINE OA** that acts as a “digital mentor” and support hub for Thailand’s 3 + million micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The OA delivers on-demand knowledge, tools, expert access, and community—all inside the messaging app that **\~54 million Thais already use daily** ([Digital Marketing for Asia][1]). By closing skills and information gaps in finance, digital marketing, e-commerce, and operations, the product helps SMEs become bankable, competitive, and growth-ready.

### 4. Market Insights (Why Now)

* **99.5 % of Thai firms are SMEs, generating 35 % + of GDP** ([World Bank][2]).
* Only **\~51–54 M⁺** LINE MAUs, making LINE the most efficient outreach channel ([Digital Marketing for Asia][1], [World Population Review][3]).
* Credit access remains difficult; **3.2 M SMEs** include many micro-entrepreneurs outside formal finance ([Bangkok Post][4]).
* Government pushes (OSMEP, BCG, SME One) require scalable digital touchpoints—an OA meets users where they already are.
