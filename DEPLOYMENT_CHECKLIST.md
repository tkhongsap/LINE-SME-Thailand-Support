# Deployment Verification Checklist

## Pre-Deployment Checks

### Environment Setup
- [ ] All Replit Secrets configured:
  - [ ] `LINE_CHANNEL_ACCESS_TOKEN`
  - [ ] `LINE_CHANNEL_SECRET`
  - [ ] `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY`
  - [ ] `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT`
  - [ ] `DATABASE_URL` (auto-configured by Replit)
  - [ ] `SESSION_SECRET`

### File Structure Validation
- [ ] 5 core files present:
  - [ ] `main.py` (Gunicorn entry point)
  - [ ] `app_simplified.py` (Flask application)
  - [ ] `openai_service.py` (Azure OpenAI service)
  - [ ] `line_service.py` (LINE API wrapper)
  - [ ] `database.py` (PostgreSQL logging)
- [ ] Configuration files:
  - [ ] `pyproject.toml` (minimal dependencies)
  - [ ] `replit.md` (documentation)

## Performance Validation

### Response Time Targets
- [ ] Health endpoint: <500ms
  ```bash
  time curl -f http://localhost:5000/health
  ```
- [ ] Root endpoint: <100ms
  ```bash
  time curl -f http://localhost:5000/
  ```

### System Health
- [ ] Gunicorn starts successfully (<30 seconds)
- [ ] Database connectivity verified
- [ ] OpenAI API responding within timeout
- [ ] Memory usage <512MB

## Functional Testing

### Endpoints
- [ ] `/health` returns JSON with status "healthy"
- [ ] `/` returns simplified service information
- [ ] `/webhook` accepts POST requests with proper signature

### Integration Tests
- [ ] Azure OpenAI client initializes without errors
- [ ] LINE signature verification working
- [ ] Database schema created automatically
- [ ] Async logging operates without blocking

## Production Readiness

### Monitoring
- [ ] Health endpoint includes database status
- [ ] Console logs visible in Replit workflow
- [ ] Error handling prevents webhook failures
- [ ] Performance metrics tracked in responses

### Security
- [ ] LINE signature verification enabled
- [ ] Environment variables properly secured
- [ ] No sensitive data in logs
- [ ] Database connections use SSL

## Post-Deployment Validation

### Performance Metrics (24hr monitoring)
- [ ] Average response time <1.5s
- [ ] Error rate <1%
- [ ] Memory usage stable
- [ ] Database connections healthy

### User Experience
- [ ] LINE messages processed correctly
- [ ] Responses generated in Thai/English
- [ ] No message loss or delays
- [ ] Conversation logging working

## Rollback Procedures

### If Issues Detected
1. **Check Replit workflow status**
2. **Review console logs for errors**
3. **Verify environment variables**
4. **Test individual service components**

### Emergency Rollback
1. **Restore from backup/** directory if needed
2. **Check database connectivity**
3. **Validate all secrets are accessible**
4. **Monitor system recovery**
