## **🚀 PULL REQUEST DETAILS**

### **PR Title**
```
🔧 Database Stability & System Reliability Improvements + Fast Path Fixes
```

### **PR Description**

# 🔧 Critical Database & Performance Fixes

## 🎯 **ISSUES RESOLVED**

### **1. Database Connection Stability (CRITICAL FIX)**
- **Problem**: PostgreSQL SSL connections dropping unexpectedly causing conversation save failures
- **Solution**: Enhanced connection pooling with shorter recycle times and improved SSL handling
- **Impact**: Eliminates `(psycopg2.OperationalError) SSL connection has been closed unexpectedly`

### **2. Enhanced Error Handling & Recovery**
- **Problem**: System errors not gracefully handled, causing cascading failures
- **Solution**: Added comprehensive retry logic with exponential backoff
- **Impact**: More resilient system with graceful degradation

### **3. Flask Context Management**
- **Problem**: `get_user_language called outside application context` warnings
- **Solution**: Improved Flask app context management in worker threads
- **Impact**: Clean logs, no more context warnings

### **4. Database Health Monitoring**
- **Problem**: No visibility into database connection health
- **Solution**: Added database health checks to `/health` endpoint
- **Impact**: Better monitoring and debugging capabilities

---

## 🔧 **KEY IMPROVEMENTS IMPLEMENTED**

### **Database Configuration Enhancements**
```python
# PostgreSQL optimizations for stability
"pool_size": 10,  # Reduced for stability
"pool_recycle": 300,  # 5 minutes (shorter for SSL stability)
"pool_pre_ping": True,  # Connection health checks
"pool_reset_on_return": "commit",  # Clean connection state
"connect_args": {
    "connect_timeout": 30,  # Increased timeout
    "sslmode": "prefer",  # Flexible SSL handling
    "options": "-c statement_timeout=30s -c idle_in_transaction_session_timeout=30s"
}
```

### **Enhanced Health Monitoring**
- **Database Status**: Real-time database connectivity monitoring
- **Connection Health**: Pool status and response times
- **Error Tracking**: Detailed error logging and recovery metrics
- **Fast Path Status**: Performance optimization monitoring

### **Improved Error Recovery**
- **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff for database operations
- **Graceful Degradation**: System continues operating despite component failures
- **Context Management**: Proper Flask app context in all worker threads
- **Connection Recovery**: Automatic connection pool recycling
